      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Update Regarding Interview for Transaction Monitoring and KYC Compliance Analyst</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Dear Jude,</h1>

    <p>I hope you're doing well! I wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you for the opportunity to interview for the Fraud Analyst role at Unigestion Holding S.A. It was a pleasure to learn more about the team, the exciting work happening at Unigestion, and the vision for the future.</p>

    <p>During our conversation, I realized I didn’t have the chance to mention my experience with external investigations, which I believe would be a strong asset in this role. My background with data analysis software like Oracle—especially in managing large datasets and generating accurate, actionable reports—could help streamline your reporting processes and strengthen data-driven decision-making across the team.</p>

    <p>I’m confident that these skills align well with the goals we discussed and would contribute meaningfully to the success of Unigestion’s fraud monitoring efforts.</p>

    <p>Thank you again for your time and consideration. I’m even more enthusiastic about the opportunity to join your team and contribute to Unigestion Holding S.A’s ongoing success. Please feel free to reach out if you need any additional information. I look forward to hearing from you soon!</p>

      <p>Best regards,</p>
