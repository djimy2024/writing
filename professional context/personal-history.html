        <h1>My Family History</h1>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Myself</h2>
            <p>My full name is <span class="bold">Djimy Francillon</span>. I was born on August 20, 1992, in Haiti. I’m a kind and positive person with good energy and I believe in progression. I’m currently a student in software development at Brigham Young University, and I’m currently working as a fraud analyst at Unigestion Holding S.A. I like to improve myself every day in some specific field and I like to have fun with friends and family, listen to music, and stay up to date about the news in the world. I’m married to a beautiful woman named <span class="bold">Vela Sanon</span> on October 22, 2022, and we have one daughter named <span class="bold">Djessie Aela Francillon</span>.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Father</h2>
            <p>My father’s name is <span class="bold">Isidor Francillon</span>. He was born on October 4, 1964, in Haiti. His father’s name was <span class="bold">Pierre Louis Francillon</span>, and his mother’s name was <span class="bold">Germaine Francois</span>. My father was a strict and protective man, who loved to work to take care of his family. He worked as a blacksmith in a self-employed job and earned his living in this field. His hobby was watching television or making music when he was not working.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Mother</h2>
            <p>My mother’s name is <span class="bold">Jacqueline Michel</span>. She was born on December 26, 1975, in Haiti. Her father’s name was <span class="bold">Delan Michel</span>, and her mother’s name was <span class="bold">Elenie Samedi</span>. My mother was one of the bravest women in the world, she was shy, responsible, protective, and resourceful. She had no education, but she did everything in her power so that her children did not miss this opportunity like she did. She was a devoted tradeswoman, and she helped her entire family, especially her children, to find something to eat, get dressed, and go to school.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Brothers and Sisters</h2>
            <p>I have 3 brothers and 2 sisters. Their names are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="bold">Gerson Francillon</span>, born on September 13, 1994, in Haiti. He is the most available and the weakest person in the family.

                <li><span class="bold">Peterson Francillon</span>, born on October 2, 2002, in Haiti. Peterson is a very energetic person and enjoys walking fast.

            </ul>
            <p>I’m the only one in my family who has the opportunity to marry. My parents were not married, and my two sisters have children but are not yet married.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>My Ancestors</h2>
            <p><span class="bold">Ancestor Stories</span></p>
            <p>My ancestors lived in the southeast of Haiti in a province called Bainet on my father’s side, and on my mother’s side, they lived in the south in a city called Beaumont.</p>
            <p>The ancestors on my father's side liked to travel all over the country to sell and buy certain products. They gave birth in different places but always raised their children well. They believed in hard work and passed this down to their families.</p>
            <p>My mother's ancestors lived in communities wherever they went, and people still recognize them for this method of solidarity. They valued work and had a strong attachment to their roots.</p>
            <p>These stories represent an identity for me. Although my father's and mother's families had different traditions, the energy and principles passed down over generations left a legacy for me that can identify me wherever I go. For example, men from my father's side used to court women with small rocks, while on my mother's side, people like to eat tree pounded with "callalou sauce," which we call "Tontonm" in Creole.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>How My Ancestors Shaped My Life</h2>
            <p>The experiences and values of my ancestors have had a profound influence on how I approach life. The lessons of hard work, perseverance, and education have been passed down through generations and shaped who I am today.</p>
            <p>My great-grandfather on my father’s side, who grew up on a small farm, had no formal education, yet he valued learning and self-education. His commitment to learning inspired many family members, including me, to view education as a lifelong pursuit.</p>
            <p>My grandmother on my mother’s side showed immense resilience in the face of illness. Her ability to adapt and rebuild when faced with adversity is something I strive to embody in my own life.</p>
            <p>Today, I continue to pass on the lessons of my ancestors. Their values of hard work, education, and resilience guide my decisions and shape how I face challenges.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Advice for Future Generations</h2>
            <p>Life is full of opportunities to learn, grow, and adapt. Never stop seeking knowledge and exploring new ideas, whether in your personal life, career, or relationships with others. Be proud of where you come from and the heritage of your ancestors, but always strive to carve out your own path in the world. Create a legacy that reflects your own values and dreams. Ultimately, the relationships you build with your family, friends, and community will bring you the most fulfillment. Invest in people, not just things.</p>
