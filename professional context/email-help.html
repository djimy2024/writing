    <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Request for Extension Due to Illness</p>

    <p>Dear Poulson,</p>

    <p>I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I have been unwell this week and, unfortunately, I missed the assignment for the week. As a result, I am unable to meet the due date for the week's development journal program.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of the week, well before the illness took its toll, I had reviewed the course material, completed the quiz questions, and participated in my team's activity for the assignment. However, I was unable to work on the assignment itself.</p>

    <p>In light of these circumstances, I kindly request an extension of two days to complete the assignment. I understand the importance of meeting deadlines and will ensure that I finish the assignment as soon as possible. Your consideration would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your understanding. Please let me know if you require any further information.</p>

    <p>Best regards,<br>
       Djimy Francillon</p>
