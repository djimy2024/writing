    <p>Dear Nicolas,</p>

    <p>I hope you are well. I am writing to address a concern that has recently arisen within our team. As you know, the rise of social media has significantly transformed the way we communicate and interact with the world. While using social media for professional purposes has undeniable benefits, I have noticed a growing problem in our workplace related to its impact on productivity.</p>

    <p>Unrestricted access to social media, whether on company computers or personal devices, has begun to hamper our team's efficiency. Employees frequently find themselves spending valuable time on social media platforms, responding to posts, tweets, and messages, resulting in a loss of focus. This time spent on these activities not only disrupts workflow but also contributes to a decrease in overall productivity. Furthermore, it often takes longer for employees to refocus on their tasks after such disruptions.</p>

    <p>I am concerned that, without a solution, the company will continue to lose valuable work time, which could affect both individual performance and the organization's overall objectives. With this in mind, I would like to propose a change to our company's social media policy. I suggest introducing stricter guidelines regarding social media use during work hours. This would allow employees to remain focused and efficient throughout their workday.</p>

    <p>I believe a more structured approach to social media access could foster a more productive work environment while still allowing employees to stay connected when needed. I would be happy to discuss this further and help implement any changes that align with the company's objectives.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing your feedback and discussing the next steps.</p>
