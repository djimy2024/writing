      <p><strong>Subject:</strong> Request for Letter of Recommendation</p>
    </div>

    <h1>Dear Desir,</h1>

    <p>I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to kindly request your support in providing me with a letter of recommendation. I am currently applying for the Transaction Monitoring and KYC Compliance Analyst position at Unigestion Holding S.A, and I believe your insight into my work and capabilities would greatly strengthen my application.</p>

    <p>As you may recall, I had the opportunity to collaborate with you on the Broadsoft project. During that time, I concentrated on customers who showed high activity outside of their scheduled parameters—an effort that, I believe, demonstrated my ability to think critically and make well-informed decisions.</p>

    <p>I’ve attached my updated résumé for your reference, which includes additional details about my professional experience and qualifications.</p>

    <p>The role I am applying for places strong emphasis on analytical thinking, critical reasoning, and investigative problem-solving. I believe that your perspective would help highlight my skills and work ethic in those areas. If you're open to writing the recommendation, I’d be happy to provide more information on the process and timeline.</p>

    <p>The letter is due by <strong>March 28, 2025</strong>, and must be submitted through an online portal. If you have any questions or need further information, please feel free to contact me anytime.</p>

    <p>Thank you in advance for your time and consideration. I truly appreciate your support and would be honored to have your recommendation.</p>

      <p>Best regards,</p>
