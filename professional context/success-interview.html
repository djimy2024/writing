        <h1 class="header">Success Interview with Vladimir Francillon</h1>

        <p class="interview-section">
            I recently interviewed Vladimir Francillon of Amazon Fulfillment to learn more about his vision of success. I was particularly interested in how he describes success and the factors that shaped his journey.
        </p>

        <p class="interview-section">
            When I asked him what the most important elements of success were, Vladimir Francillon explained that success is not only about achieving external goals, but also about finding personal satisfaction and fulfillment. According to him:
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
            "Success is living in alignment with my values and being proud of the person I have become."
        </div>

        <p class="interview-section">
            One of the most interesting parts of the conversation came when I asked him about the challenges he had faced. He described a time in his career where he had to face failure during an interview. However, he shared that this experience taught him resilience and the importance of perseverance:
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
            "It was one of the most difficult times, but I learned that true success comes from overcoming the difficult times."
        </div>

        <p class="interview-section">
            I asked him what his greatest achievement would be, and Vladimir Francillon explained to me that:
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
            "I am not an accomplished person but if I had to highlight something that I consider a great achievement it would be my ability to help people in so many different ways. Whether it is offering advice in difficult times, helping someone solve a problem, or generating new ideas, my main goal is to be useful and supportive."
        </div>

        <p class="interview-section">
            Then, I asked him what motivates him to continue when things get tough, and Vladimir Francillon explained to me that:
        </p>

        <div class="quote">
            "When things are tough, I think about my goal, the reasons why I started, especially for my family, my faith in the Lord, and the inspiration of others."
        </div>

        <p class="interview-section">
            Finally, when I asked him what his current goals were, Vladimir Francillon spoke passionately about his efforts to achieve financial independence in five years. He explained that he measures success by the progress he makes, rather than the end result. This is in line with his belief that success is a lifelong journey.
        </p>

        <p class="interview-section">
            In conclusion, my conversation with Vladimir Francillon gave me valuable insights into the personal nature of success. He showed that the idea of success does not have an end point, but is a continuous process of improvement, challenge, and alignment with oneâ€™s established core values.
