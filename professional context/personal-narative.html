  <h1>Personal Life Reflections</h1>

  <h2>Working Toward a Degree</h2>
  <p>
    The day I received my college acceptance letter felt surreal. After years of dreaming of the day I could finally call myself a student again, the moment had arrived. But it wasn’t as simple as starting classes. It took a solid plan to get me back to school. In my early thirties, working full-time and managing a small family, the decision to go back to school was nothing short of a challenge.
  </p>
  <p>
    I had spent days thinking about continuing my education, but I kept neglecting the idea. At first, I wasn’t even sure it was possible. It wasn’t until I heard a talk by Mary N. Cook titled <span class="highlight">"Seek knowledge: you have work to do"</span> that I understood how essential it was for my career. The phrase stuck with me.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enrolled in an online program that allowed flexibility. During Block 1, I had many sleepless nights trying to keep up with coursework while working 8 am to 5 pm, Monday to Saturday. At times, I wanted to give up, but thinking of my goal to support my family gave me strength. I leaned on prayer and sought help from classmates.
  </p>
  <p>
    Completing Block 1 brought not just relief but also a deeper understanding of my own resilience. This journey taught me that <span class="highlight">perseverance</span> through difficult times is key to achieving our future goals.
  </p>

  <h2>A Childhood Memory</h2>
  <p>
    I was twelve the first time I traveled alone from one city to another. Having grown up in a modest neighborhood, I had only heard stories of the beauty of the city. During winter, while my family traveled to our home province, I stayed behind, eager to experience the city’s festivities, parades, and fireworks.
  </p>
  <p>
    The most memorable moments happened late at night — watching movies, exchanging gifts, staying up to challenge each other to see who could sleep the latest. One Christmas, I stayed up an entire night and the following day without rest. I eventually collapsed at my godmother’s house, exhausted. But after a short recovery, I returned to the party, ready to enjoy it again.
  </p>
  <p>
    That memory stays with me — the magic of the city, the joy of exploration, and the warmth of community. It taught me the importance of <span class="highlight">curiosity</span> and embracing new experiences, even in childhood.
  </p>

  <h2>Meeting My Spouse</h2>
  <p>
    The day I met my partner was quite ordinary. I was buying something from her shop, and curiosity led me to ask if she made the items herself. After that brief interaction, we didn’t speak for months.
  </p>
  <p>
    One day in October, my brother called me outside to tell me someone was asking for me — it was her. We talked, and I invited her to an evening event. That evening changed my life. We started with light jokes, then discussed school, family, religion, and work. When we shook hands goodnight, I felt something different.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over time, what started as casual conversation became a deep friendship, then love. There were no grand romantic gestures — just small moments of <span class="highlight">trust, patience, and laughter</span>. Our relationship grew slowly but steadily.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, after years together, building a family and a future, I see how our bond was rooted in the little things. Love isn’t always about sparks; it’s about building something real — together.
  </p>
